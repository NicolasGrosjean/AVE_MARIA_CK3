## MOD VISION

AVE MARIA is the very consise acronym of **A Very Extensive Modification for Appropriate Realism and Improved Authenticity**. The mod's objective is to adapt [Crusader Kings 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/) with more contextually accurate mechanics and events as is humanly possible within the limits of engine, modding and gameplay.

Crusader Kings 3 falls right into medievalism, that is if we are to quote Umberto Eco, "a dream of the Middle Ages", a re-construction full of ideological attachment to values associated with medieval societies that we can find all over popular culture media that often hides a reality only the medievalists and specialist academics usually see.

This mod is founded on the belief that latest scholarly research on the Middle Ages can and should influence the game's features to improve gameplay.

## CURRENT FEATURES
- Unique new government and mechanics for the Eastern Roman Empire: a bureaucratic system allowing office terms and competing for administrative posts.
- Unique new government and mechanics for the Islamic Empires and polities, chiefly the Fatimids and Seljuks: a bureaucratic system with competing factions and interest groups.
- More than 30 new personality traits as well as rework of the existing ones based on the psychological HEXACO model.
- Increased county granularity: counties only have one barony for outside of realm succession.
