## 23/04/2020
## v0.2-alpha
# Communication Efficiency
- Added a communication efficiency mechanic: counties distant from the capital get a malus to county Control based on their distance, terrain and buildings (Roads (new building) and Ports which decrease the malus). Enclaved counties (no path to the capital that does not involve going through someone else territory) have their Control decreased to 20.
- Added the Via Egnetia road network for the Romans (still more historical roads to be placed!)
# Roman Administration additions by Conchodebar
- Added a new Thermal Cure decision and events available to character geographically near Crius province (near Constantinople on the anatolian coast) and in poor health to visit the thermal sources of Pythia or Prusa
- Added a new Born in the Purple event triggered to children born...to the Basileus.
# Islamic Empires
- Added new government, Dawla government to represent the islamic centralized bureaucratic state. Clan government still exists and keeps its vanilla feature and is to be seen as something more akin to vanilla tribals.
- Added new vassal contracts for empire tier muslims and their duchy tier vassals: Kharaj right, Qadi right, Dynastic Inheritance, War Declaration right, Iqta and Thugur.
- Added new vassal contracts for islamic rulers in general: Muslim Taxation, Dhimmi Taxation (taxes available only to jewish/christian vassals)
- Replaced the Court Chaplain Councillor position for muslim into Qadi position. The convert task has been replaced by a new task "Render Local Justice" improving local county opinion
- Duchy tier vassals of a Dawla government ruler cannot name their own Qadi/Steward without the corresponding vassal contract law, instead a new decision to ask their liege to name a new official is available
- Added new mechanic for muslim clan and tribal government rulers: Asabiyya. Inspired by Ibn Khaldoun principle, it represents the bond of cohesion among humans in a group-forming community, it is social solidarity with an emphasis on unity, group consciousness, and a sense of shared purpose and social cohesion. Familiar in pre-islamic and islamic era, in game terms it provides various bonuses to rulers maintaining their Asabiyya strong (Skirmishers and light cavalry combat bonus, raid speed increase, vassal opinion and prestige gain). It is reduced when the realm_capital holding of a character is not of the Nomad type and can be increased through various traits or events.
- Added new Settlement type: Nomad Controlled Settlement, to represent local power by pastoral type of actors.
- When Asabiyya reaches 0, the character changes to a Dawla government.
- Added a new Empire title for the Fatimid with a new succession law similar to a vanilla heir designation
- Added a new decision for muslim ruler to recruit a learned character.
- Added a new decision for the Fatimid Imam to recruit military slave teenagers to be trained as slave soldiers.

# Berber Rework by TheNunnceler

Barring exceptional individuals (or proven Commander guardians), 16 year old will not get the highest martial tier but can learn to be better commanders during battles either as commanders or as knights (half of the experience).
